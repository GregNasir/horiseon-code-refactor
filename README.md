# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Refactoring of existing code for Horiseon's landing page

While maintaining it's original presentation and functions; this webpage's coding was refactored to provide a more concise and clear understanding, of its html and css elements. Durinig refactoring, several actions were taken to refine the underbelly of the website, while potentially improving performance. These include:

* Semantic HTML used to provide more descriptive coding, in a logical structure
* Comments added to describe roles of elements used
* Classes were created to simplify coding of elements with similar styling
* Alt attributes were completed with decriptive text
* Heading attributes were placed in squential order.
* CSS file restructured to group classes and elements in semantic structure
* Website continously tested to maintain expected functionality
* Commits to github to maintain latest adjustments
* Title name added to clearly describe business model

While going through the steps of refactoring this webiste, I learned that there are
several differents ways to get the same result. However, being concise and
desriptive reads really well, and will be very helpful to any fellow developer,
that might be tasked with working with this code, in the future.

## Installation

All files including index.html were added, committed and pushed to GitHub. GitHub pages' deployment feature, was used to deploy the refactored website.
